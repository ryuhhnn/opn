# opn

A small CLI tool for quickly launching apps

## Download

I'm pretty sure you can download the binary directly from the `/dist` folder. (I haven't tried this yet so good luck).

If you want to build from source and you have go installed, clone this repo and `cd` into the directory and run `go install`.

## Quick Start

To add a new alias: `opn add <ALIAS> <PATH_TO_APP>`

To list all saved aliases: `opn list`

To open an app: `opn <ALIAS>`

There's always: `opn help`

## Documentation

This project is a WIP and will be documented throughout the course of development.

## Contributing

Sure, why not? I'm not gonna stop you from submitting a pull-request, but you should probably open an [issue](https://github.com/ryuhhnn/opn/issues/new) with the `feature-request` label first so that you don't waste your time writing something that won't get merged in.
